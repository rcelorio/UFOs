# UFOs - The Truth Is Out There

This repository contains an exercise in dynamic html content using JavaScript and Bootstrap. The page index.html accepts any combination of 5 filters. The data table refreshes after each drop down selection.  Use the "Reset Table" button to start over. 

The page and filters work as expected but our dataset is static. Future development should seek a data source with more sightings across countries and more recent data. Another development suggestion would be to use scraping methods to gather information on each sighting. With the sighting information we could build a new html template to provide more detail about each sighting.
